# This script emits pretty top output periodically. It subsets the top
# columns, and color codes the CPU and COMMAND columns.
#
# Via $NEEDS_TOP_PS, it can optionally generate a `ps` table of
# anonymous `node` processes, which can help with understanding why
# top shows cpu consumption for these otherwise fairly anonymous
# processes.
